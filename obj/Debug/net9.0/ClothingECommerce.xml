        <member name="T:ClothingECommerce.Data.AppDbContextFactory">
            <summary>
            A factory class for creating instances of AppDbContext at design time, used by Entity Framework Core tools.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This class implements the IDesignTimeDbContextFactory interface to provide a way to create AppDbContext instances
            during design-time operations, such as running EF Core migrations or scaffolding.
            It reads the database connection string from appsettings.json and configures the DbContext to use SQL Server.
            The factory is not used at runtime; it is specifically for EF Core tooling.

        <member name="M:ClothingECommerce.Data.AppDbContextFactory.CreateDbContext(System.String[])">
            <summary>
            Creates an instance of AppDbContext for design-time operations.
            </summary>
            <param name="args">Command-line arguments passed to the EF Core tools (not used in this implementation).</param>
            <returns>
            An instance of AppDbContext configured with the SQL Server connection string from appsettings.json.
            </returns>
            <remarks>
            This method is called by EF Core tools (e.g., `dotnet ef migrations add`) to create an AppDbContext instance.
            It loads the connection string from appsettings.json, configures the DbContextOptions, and returns a new AppDbContext.
            The method ensures that migrations and other design-time operations can access the database configuration.

            If true, the authentication cookie is set to persist for 30 days; otherwise, it is session-based.
            This property is used to configure the cookie's persistence in the AccountController.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This class is used to validate user input during registration attempts in the e-commerce application.
            It is typically sent as JSON in the body of a POST request to the /Account/SignUp endpoint.
            The model includes validation attributes to ensure the name, email, password, and phone number meet specific requirements,
            aligning with the Customer model's database constraints and validation rules.
